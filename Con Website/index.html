        <h1>Why Condoms?</h1>
        <p>A condom is a thin cover that is put on a man's penis and used during sexual intercourse. It is normally made of latex. Condoms are a form of birth control, they can prevent a pregnancy. They can also prevent the spread of certain sexually transmitted infections, such as gonorrhea, syphilis, or HIV. Another name for a condom is prophylactic sheath.

        In 2009, most condoms were made of latex. For people with latex allergy, plastic condoms are available.
        
        The first condoms were made of tissue paper. Later models were made of the intestines of animals, suchas sheep. Such condoms can still be found sometimes. Certain people prefer sheepskin condoms over latexones, because sheepskin condoms can transfer body warmth better. However they do not prevent diseasesas effectively as latex condoms.
        
        Condoms are popular for several reasons. They are inexpensive and can be bought without a prescriptionby either a man or a woman. They can be bought at many locations, and they are easy to use (once thecouple learns how.) They have no health-related side effects for either the man or the woman, and theyare one of the few types of birth control that also reduce the spread of infections. If the coupledecides to have a baby, they can stop using condoms at any time and begin trying to get pregnant withno delay.
        
        But condoms have some disadvantages. During sex, the couple must stop to put on the condom just beforebeginning intercourse, which interrupts and distracts them at an exciting time. Condoms reduce thephysical feelings of intercourse, especially for the man, who cannot feel the heat and sensation of thewoman's vagina as much. Condoms can also reduce the emotional closeness the man and woman feel duringintercourse because there is something between them. Condoms are less effective than many other typesof birth control, and if a couple is in a steady relationship and are having sex very often, condomscan become more expensive to use. For these reasons, once a man and woman are in a steady relationshipand are sure they are free of infection, the woman often begins to use birth control pills or someother highly effective contraceptive, after which the couple stops using condoms.</p>
