        <h1>Know about us</h1>
        <p>Durex is a brand of condoms and personal lubricants owned by the Anglo-Dutch company Reckitt Benckiser. It was initially developed in London under the purview of the London Rubber Company and British Latex Products Ltd, where it was manufactured between 1932 and 1994.[1][2] The London Rubber Company was formed in 1915, and the Durex brand name ("Durability, reliability, and excellence") was launched in 1929 although London Rubber did not begin manufacturing own-brand condoms until 1932, in collaboration with a rubber technology student from Poland named Lucian Landau.[1][2][3] The first book on The London Rubber Company and the history of Durex condoms, written by Jessica Borge, was published in September 2020 by McGill-Queen's University Press.[1][2]

        The London Rubber Company later merged with SSL International, since 2010 which has been owned by theAnglo-Dutch company Reckitt Benckiser. It is one of the best-selling condom brands around the world,with 30% of the global market.[4] In 2006, Durex condoms were the second best-selling brand of condomsin the United States, with Trojan condoms being the first. It is supplied by, among others, the companyKarex.[5]
        
        In 2007 the last factory making Durex condoms in the UK stopped manufacturing and production has sincemoved to China, India and Thailand.[4] The modern range includes a wide variety of latex condom,including the Sheik and Ramses brands in North America,[6] and the Avanti condom. Durex also provides arange of lubricants and sex toys.
